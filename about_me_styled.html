            There are twenty four people in history to have traveled to the moon.
            <br>I am not one of them. Would be pretty cool, though.

        <h1 strong>My Experience</h1 strong>
        <p>
            I completed my first degree in Teaching English as a Second Language in 2019.
            With a minor in Japanese and a strong understanding of linguistics, my goal 
            was to become an English instructor in Japan, but the COVID-19 pandemic put a 
            hold on that plan. Spending more time at home
            teaching remotely (and throwing in the occasional gaming session), I started
            thinking about how the laptop in front of me worked behind the scenes. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My interest in linguistics led me to free tutorials and classes teaching
            the basics of programming, and I soon found myself returning to Kent State University
            to get a bachelor's degree in computer science. I learned useful skills
            needed in a wide variety of computer science fields, my main focus being
            video game development. With experience in C++, C#, and game engines
            like Unity and Unreal, I hope to build a long career giving back to the
            gaming community.
